## Sharing my research notes

As I use [Roam](http://roamresearch.com/) and learn to [work differently](https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1257984026872340480?s=20). I'm starting to take long, messy, meandering notes and [Write small, self-contained notes](write-small-self-contained-notes){:target="_blank"} based on them. As I revisit and improve my notes, I'll share them here.

P.S. This page is inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now).
