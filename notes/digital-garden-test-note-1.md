Ok, so this note should connect to [Digital Garden Test $Note '2'](digital-garden-test-note-2).

I'll also include an outline here. 

- I think this approach should work well enough.
    - It's homegrown.
    - I understand how it works.
    - And it's fairly simple
- [Stroll](https://giffmex.org/stroll/stroll.html) maybe be better in some ways.
    - After all, it has a nice feature to provide previews on hover.
    - But that isn't really a killer feature.
    - It's trivial to find backlinks and such on my own.
        - So I should be fine this way.
