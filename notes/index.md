Howdy! These are my notes on artificial general intelligence and related interests. You can explore them in several ways: [missing note](missing-note){:target="_blank"}

- [Browse by creation date](https://carlosd.org/notes/created)
- [Browse by when they were last updated](https://carlosd.org/notes/updated)
- [Scroll through all my notes on one page](https://carlosd.org/notes/all)

Btw, I use [Roam](http://roamresearch.com/) to write my notes, and then I export some of them here using a script I wrote. Here's a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1260421394938114055?s=20) with more info.
