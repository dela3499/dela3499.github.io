title: Writing prose is like writing code


---



There are many ways in which writing prose is like writing code. Both often involve ambitious projects, and encoding large amounts of precisely-stated knowledge in a complex and interconnected way. The mechanisms of abstraction, modularity, and so on are different, but the same fundamental problems appear in both domains. Many of these problems are the result of scale - of creating things which grow larger and large - more difficult to keep in mind and understand all at once.

Also, writers can make use of fundamental data structures like sequences, sets, outlines, and networks. I'm not sure writers need to keep these structures explicitly in mind, after all, it's much more important to think in terms of things like paragraphs, sentences, and so on.
