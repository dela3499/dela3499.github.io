    \ previews on hover.\n    - But that isn't really a killer feature.\n    - It's\
    \ trivial to find backlinks and such on my own.\n        - So I should be fine\
    \ this way.\n\n# New Section Mofos!\n\nHere's a tag link to [Digital Garden Test\
    \ $Note '2'](#digital-garden-test-note-2). Not only does it test my ability to\
    \ handle tags, it also tests that I don't show multiple backlinks to this note\

  content_with_hash_links: "\n\nThis note is fairly simple. I just want to use it\
    \ to display various paragraphs, and show how I can flatten blocks. (Also, you\
    \ may have noticed that the title contains some odd characters in it. Those shouldn't\
    \ be included in the url or filename, though they'll appear as aliases for any\
    \ links to this note.)\n\nSo, this is a child block. \n\nAnd another. \n\nBut\
    \ these should all appear as new paragraphs.\n\nI guess I may as well create a\
    \ new outline here just for fun.\n\n- [Digital Garden Test Note 1](#digital-garden-test-note-1)\n\
