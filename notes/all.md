    ## Researching artificial general intelligence


    I''m currently exploring a [variety of questions](https://carlosd.substack.com/p/6-a-few-questions-on-agi),
    and sharing what I learn in these [notes](https://carlosd.org/notes) and in my
    [newsletter](http://carlosd.substack.com/) (where I hope to improve my writing,
    guided by Steven Pinker''s [A Sense of Style](https://www.amazon.com/Sense-Style-Thinking-Persons-Writing/dp/0143127799)).
    I''m also working on a short book.


    ## Making music


    I''ve gotten much better at drumming over the last few months (thanks to [Drumeo](drumeo.com)).
    Now I''m working on recording drum parts for my music, which is inspired by the
    prog rock band Rush and by various classical composers (e.g. Debussy). To improve
    my music, I''m also learning about music composition, music notation, and the
    art of storytelling in fiction. Inspired by [Ichika Nito](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq3Wpi10SyZkzVeS7vzB5Lw),
    I''m recording 100 microsongs to put on Youtube.


    ## Roam book and Roam site generator


    As I continue to use [Roam](http://roamresearch.com/) for my all my personal and
    research notes, I''ve [learned to use it more effectively](https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1257984026872340480?s=20)
    and aim to eventually share those lessons in a book. I''ve also created a tool
    to easily publish a selection of my Roam notes online (this site was published
    that way, and this page was written in Roam). Once I make it easier to use, I
    aim to start selling it as a product others can use to publish a notes website
    like this one.


    P.S. This page is inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now).

    \ to do it - they need to write the implementation. In the case of writing, one\
    \ sometimes knows __what__ to say, but not yet __how__ to say it. That is like\
    \ the programmer. But sometimes, while writing, you may just have a question,\
    \ and have no idea where it leads. You could be making an argument, and maybe\
    \ wonder if it is correct. In this case, you could continue writing the present\

    I think this is the primary danger for any individual. One can get stuck with
    respect to just one project or pursuit, or perhaps stuck with regard to everything.
    Because Stasis is hell, I think the main job of any tool or way of life, workflow,
    or whatever, is to avoid getting stuck.

    \ When it comes to writing, one can [Write small, self-contained notes](#write-small-self-contained-notes),\
    \ but that is not enough. A book contains __many__ ideas, and has to be comprehensible\
    \ to readers, not only the author. This introduces many new problems, the first\
    \ one being how to arrange all those hundreds of ideas into a coherent structure.\
    \ This can't be done all at once. Ideas are related in all sorts of ways, and\
    \ it's a creative challenge just to figure out the order in which to present __two__\
    \ ideas, much less __hundreds__. \n\nMoreover, a book is not just the concatenation\
    \ of existing ideas in the proper order. Some ideas will appear in multiple forms\
    \ in multiple places. Some will be dropped. Some will be elaborated upon with\
    \ background knowledge and helpful examples. New ideas will be introduced, and\
    \ old ideas expressed anew, in the process of writing a manuscript others can\
    \ read. The process of integrating all these ideas will turn up unforeseen conflicts\
    \ and problems between ideas which hadn't been considered together in such detail\
    \ before. Trying to express an idea clearly and succinctly requires understanding\
    \ it well, and making it sharper, and this can lead to all sorts of new ideas,\
    \ and changes to old ones.\n\nThese are all problems of substance, but there are\
    \ also problems of communication - of language. That is another layer of problems\
    \ - creating sharp sentences, paragraphs, pages, and chapters. Putting things\
    \ in perspective - emphasizing what is most important, and sequencing things so\
    \ they are easy to understand, and one is exposed to one idea only after prerequisite\
    \ ideas have been introduced.\n\nIn other words, a books' worth of ideas is __not__\
    \ a book. Making it into a book (or essay, or whatever) will introduce __many__\
    \ new problems (in the good sense of the word, not necessarily distressing ones).\
    \ Problems of substance and of communication. If you cannot break these problems\
    \ down to a manageable size, you cannot write the book. You'll get stuck.\n\n\
    So, __how__ do you break these problems into a manageable size? What are the problems?\
    \ \n\nThe curse of knowledge - providing the relevant background knowledge and\
    \ context for others to understand not only what you are saying, but why it is\
    \ important and interesting.\n\nBasic clarity and concision - creating clear sentences,\
    \ using the right words. \n\nCoherence and continuity - making things flow from\
    \ one sentence to the next. \n\nMaking things tractable for the reader - chapter\
    \ titles and section breaks allow the reader to skip around, and to find and refer\
    \ to sections they care about, to recall what they're read.\n\nThe problems of\
    \ structure and modularity - understanding the ideas at various levels of abstraction.\
    \ The high-level patterns and relationships. Some ideas are more important than\
    \ others, more high level, more fundamental, whatever. Some ideas belong in a\
    \ certain sequence, or in a certain group. Maybe they are part of the same topic\
    \ or argument. Just like pages allow you to make small, self-contained chunks,\
    \ you need to create chapters and outlines and other things to create small (relative\
    \ to the size of the whole book), self-contained chunks. Just like with notes,\
    \ that is nontrivial and creative.\n\nWhat about [Chunk ideas into manageable\

    While the act of writing can be useful on it own, the text one creates can be
    a great help in future thinking. If you [Write small, self-contained notes](#write-small-self-contained-notes),
    and give them good titles, they become easy to build upon in other notes. Treat
    your notes as an API, as building blocks and stepping stones to become familiar
    with and build upon. This chunking of ideas helps you think about things at higher
    levels of abstraction, and takes things which might have been difficult to think
    about before, and makes them easy. One note can also constrain other notes.

    Many problems are too difficult to solve in one go. To make progress on them -
    to [Avoid getting stuck](#avoid-getting-stuck) -  one has to divide the problem
    into many smaller, simpler, easier ones. This is true of problem-solving in every
    domain, from AGI research to music and writing books.


    If you don''t break the problem down, it may be needlessly difficult or painful
    to work on. It may even be so overwhelming you become stuck and make no progress
    at all.


    Incidentally, breaking a problem down is creative (and fun!) and a special case
    of a more fundamental mental phenomenon: [Minds divide the world into independent,
    interacting objects](#minds-divide-the-world-into-independent-interacting-objects).

    \ it? (Or against alternatives?)\n- What are the alternatives?\n- Is this clear?\n\
    - What is a better way to write this?\n- Should I break these idea into separate\

    \ why?\n- How should I start the piece?\n- What is the scope of the piece? What\
    \ should be included or excluded?\n\nSwitching between many such questions in\

    \ single step forward.\n\nHow can you break up these things into small, manageable\
    \ steps? How can you take a draft and start reshaping it slowly-but-surely into\
    \ something better?\n\nWell, one thing you can do is just go through a draft several\
    \ times, each time trying to fix just one kind of problem. Maybe the first time,\
    \ you just cut unnecessary things. Then you can try to rewrite ideas to be shorter.\
    \ Then you can put things in the proper sequence. Then you can try to improve\
    \ the points - or perhaps that should come first.\n\nMaybe the really central\
    \ and first point of revising should be to revise the ideas themselves. To find\
    \ flaws and gaps. That is, after all, how I have approached writing blog posts.\
    \ Try to state the problem or starting point clearly, and move from there in an\
    \ orderly and logical way. I first thought I might avoid this as I write my notes.\
    \ I thought that sort of writing might constitute an unnecessary and wasteful\
    \ level of polish. But, perhaps it's just the opposite, and expressing an idea\
    \ from beginning to end in a clear and continuous chain of argument is __the__\
    \ advantage of writing real prose rather than just bullet-point notes. So, I guess\
    \ I'd like to revise my idea about sharing public notes.\n\nInstead of sharing\
    \ my half-baked ideas, the point is to improve them dramatically. To try to get\
    \ to the crux of the matter, and to put them forward in an extremely clear, crisp,\
    \ and compelling way. Each time I turn to a note can be an attempt to improve\
    \ its quality in a fundamental way.\n\nHaving said that, this is a costly thing\
    \ to do, and it means that I may not publish as often as I first thought. Then\
    \ again, if you begin publishing one compelling note per day this way, that will\
    \ constitute a dramatic increase in your output. \n\nReal prose at a rate of 300\
    \ words per day yields 100k+ words per year. That's no small thing.\n\nThe other\
    \ side of this is that it means __not everything should be a public note__. Not\
    \ everything merits the effort. Some things should remain private. This level\
    \ of investment in each idea means that you'll work on only the important ones.\
    \ That is probably as it should be.\n\n\n"

    When composing music, there''s a constant tension between familiarity and novelty
    - repetition and change. Pure repetition is boring. Pure change is confusing.


    I quite like Rush, and they''ve managed to produce music which is ambitious and
    full of variety and change, but also easy to follow. Transitions makes sense.
    One thing lead into to another. Things never seem haphazard or chaotic. There''s
    almost always a steady groove one can tap one''s foot to, even if it''s in an
    odd time signature.


    On the other hand, much prog rock and classical music is very confusing (especially
    to the untrained ear). Things lack a steady pulse, speed up and slow down, change
    rhythms continually, take long pauses and restart unpredictably.


    Whether one is creating melodies or drum parts, one can make things easy to follow
    by limiting major changes to those between sections (and by doing work on either
    side of section transitions to make them ''make sense''). Within a section, one
    can explore a variety of ideas in the form of __variations__ of a core idea. In
    this way, one introduces novelty and surprise in the details, but maintains a
    predictable overall structure.


    Incidentally, it''s not only easier to listen to. It''s easier to __compose__
    variations than entirely new ideas.

    All living things depend on knowledge. This is especially true of people, since
    we so obviously rely on science, culture, and technology. But, even plants and
    animals depend on the knowledge embodied in genes, without which they couldn''t
    manage the kaleidoscopic chemical complexity of even the simplest cell.


    But, there was once a time when __no__ knowledge existed - not in any book, brain,
    or bacterium. It all had to be created. How? Variation and selection, or conjecture
    and criticism (in the words of [Karl Popper](#karl-popper)).


    Because __all__ knowledge-creation depends on variation and selection, it''s possible
    to [compare knowledge-creating systems](#compare-knowledge-creating-systems).

    ideas about [AGI](#agi) to biological evolution, machine learning, and business,

    cases of more general things which __do__ apply in every case. The same is true

    \ Coping with that problem is uniquely easy with page links. \n\nIronically, linking\
    \ to a note using its descriptive title makes the connections between ideas __clearer__.\
    \ In a single note, you only know that one chunk of text follows another. It can\
    \ be hard to tell where one idea ends and another begins. And, this problem becomes\
    \ worse as more ideas are present in a document. So, page references offer a key\
    \ tool that allows you to express connections in a very powerful way. \n\n(All\
    \ the same arguments apply to block references, too, though that is even more\
    \ foreign than page links. At least with page links, we can rely on our knowledge\
    \ of the web. Block references are a bit more like referencing tweets, which is\
    \ less common.)\n\nWorking on boundaries and interfaces helps you better understand\
    \ the ideas, incidentally, since you are working to find not only how to express\
    \ them in a short, self-contained way, but also explicitly define the relationships\
    \ between multiple such chunks. This has the effect of taking a very complex bundle\
    \ of ideas and pulling it apart into distinct, coherent ideas with distinct, specific\
    \ connections. So, this is largely about constraints. This is big with Elm, where\
    \ the whole idea is that, as you scale up, you need to find ways to constrain\
    \ things so that when you try to solve a bug, for instance, you can quickly determine\
    \ a small set of possibilities, because only a few thing can possibly have affected\
    \ the relevant code. If the system is less constrained, then many more things\
    \ could have affected the code and caused the bug. Likewise here, one wants to\
    \ specify the connections fairly precisely. Not quite for finding bugs.\n\nBy\
    \ the way, tags allow you to put a note in a certain __set__ of notes, and this\
    \ is also a useful way to create boundaries. But, instead of being about making\
    \ a single idea manageable, it's about how to [Chunk ideas into manageable groups\
    \ using outlines](#chunk-ideas-into-manageable-groups-using-outlines).\n\nReferences\n\
