    ## Researching artificial general intelligence


    I''m currently exploring a [variety of questions](https://carlosd.substack.com/p/6-a-few-questions-on-agi),
    and sharing what I learn in these [notes](https://carlosd.org/notes) and in my
    [newsletter](http://carlosd.substack.com/) (where I hope to improve my writing,
    guided by Steven Pinker''s [A Sense of Style](https://www.amazon.com/Sense-Style-Thinking-Persons-Writing/dp/0143127799)).


    ## Making music


    I''ve gotten much better at drumming over the last few months (thanks to [Drumeo](drumeo.com)).
    Now I''m working on recording drum parts for my music, which is inspired by the
    prog rock band Rush and by various classical composers (e.g. Debussy). To improve
    my music, I''m also learning about music composition, music notation, and the
    art of storytelling in fiction.


    ## Roam book and Roam site generator


    As I continue to use [Roam](http://roamresearch.com/) for my all my personal and
    research notes, I''ve [learned to use it more effectively](https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1257984026872340480?s=20)
    and aim to eventually share those lessons in a book. I''ve also created a tool
    to easily publish a selection of my Roam notes online (this site was published
    that way, and this page was written in Roam). Once I make it easier to use, I
    aim to start selling it as a product others can use to publish a notes website
    like this one.


    P.S. This page is inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now).

    \ true of people, since we so obviously rely on science, culture, and technology.\
    \ But, even plants and animals depend on the knowledge embodied in genes, without\
    \ which they couldn't manage the kaleidoscopic chemical complexity of even the\
    \ simplest cell.\n\nBut, there was once a time when __no__ knowledge existed -\
    \ not in any book, brain, or bacterium. It all had to be created. How? In every\
    \ case, it is created by variation and selection (aka conjecture and criticism)\
    \ as [Karl Popper](#karl-popper) argued. \n\nThis deep similarity makes it possible\
    \ to [compare knowledge-creating systems](#compare-knowledge-creating-systems),\
    \ and their differences make such comparisons fruitful. Lessons learned in one\
    \ domain can be applied to others. Many [questions about knowledge](#questions-about-knowledge)\
    \ apply to __every__ system that depends on or creates it. I often try to apply\
    \ ideas about [AGI](#agi) to biological evolution, machine learning, and business,\
    \ and see whether they work. They often don't, and I learn that they are special\
    \ cases of more general things which __do__ apply in every case. The same is true\
    \ of many [obstacles to knowledge-creation](#obstacles-to-knowledge-creation).\n\
