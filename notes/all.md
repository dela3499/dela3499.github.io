    ## Sharing my research notes


    As I use [Roam](http://roamresearch.com/) and learn to [work differently](https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1257984026872340480?s=20).
    I''m starting to take long, messy, meandering notes and [Write small, self-contained
    notes](#write-small-self-contained-notes) based on them. As I revisit and improve
    my notes, I''ll share them here.


    P.S. This page is inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now).
