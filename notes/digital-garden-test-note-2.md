This note is fairly simple. I just want to use it to display various paragraphs, and show how I can flatten blocks. (Also, you may have noticed that the title contains some odd characters in it. Those shouldn't be included in the url or filename, though they'll appear as aliases for any links to this note.)

So, this is a child block. 

And another. 

But these should all appear as new paragraphs.

I guess I may as well create a new outline here just for fun.
